# Vindicta-Core Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-01

## Core Principles

### I. Dependency Direction
Core has NO dependencies on other Vindicta modules. All arrows point inward.

### II. Stability
Breaking changes require major version bumps and migration guides.

### III. Minimal Surface
Expose only what's needed. Prefer composition over inheritance.

### IV. Configuration Safety
All settings MUST have sensible defaults and validation.
